# Numerical-Analysis
These are some common and well known numerical analysis codes used in applied/computational mathematics. The main sources are from my personal notes from courses I took in applied mathematics and scientific computing from Fall 2020-Fall 2021. Most of my codes are my own creation while some others are adapted, usually with heavy modification, from the textbook A First Course in Numerical Methods by Uri M. Ascher and Chen Greif. This repository will likely continue to build over time as I develop new or adapt existing numerical analysis algorithms for my own research and/or my own personal interests. Please feel free to message me regarding any questions or requests!
