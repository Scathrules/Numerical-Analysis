# Numerical-Analysis
These are some common and well known numerical analysis codes used in applied/computational mathematics. The main sources are from my personal notes from a course I took in applied mathematics and scientific computing and from A First Course in Numerical Methods by Uri M. Ascher and Chen Greif. This repository will likely continue to build over time as I develop existing or new numerical analysis codes for my own research and/or my own interests. Please feel free to message me regarding any questions or requests!
